 * @defgroup VillainContentType Villain Content Types
 *
 * This package defines the type system for Villain content.
 *
 * The type system is structured as follows:
 *
 * A TypeDefinition is composed of zero or more Field objects, where each Field 
 * describes an individual storage unit (i.e. a Field) on the object. Villain comes with
 * a variety of predefined fields, including IntegerField for modeling integers, 
 * StringField to model text data, and GroupField to model a group of other fields.
